# File Duplicate Detector

## Intention
- Computer cleanup and organization

If multiple of the same files were accidentally downloaded with different names, for example two identical word documents or photos on your computer, this program will scan whichever path you choose and show you which files are duplicates, which aren't, why they were flagged as duplicates, and the options to delete duplicates.
